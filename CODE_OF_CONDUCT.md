# Code of Conduct: Bincode-next

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the minimum standards for acceptable behavior for all contributors, maintainers, and participants in the **Bincode-next** project, across all platforms including GitHub, Codeberg, and any related communication channels.

The purpose of this CoC is to ensure a **safe, respectful, inclusive, and legally compliant** environment for everyone involved, enabling collaborative development focused on the technical goals of the project.

## 2. Our Commitment to the Law and Ethical Conduct

**All participants are required to adhere to all applicable national, state, and local laws.** This CoC is not a substitute for legal compliance, but rather reinforces our commitment to it.

### 2.1. Prohibition of Illegal Activities

Any activity that is illegal under applicable law is strictly prohibited, including but not limited to:

* **Doxxing and Harassment:** As explicitly stated in the project charter, any form of doxxing (the unauthorized, malicious publication of private, identifying information about an individual or organization) or harassment is **not tolerated**. This includes cyberbullying, stalking, threats of violence, or any action intended to intimidate or cause distress.
* **Hate Speech and Discrimination:** We will not tolerate any speech or conduct that constitutes discrimination or harassment based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political affiliation, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, or any other legally protected characteristic.
* **Intellectual Property Violations:** Plagiarism, copyright infringement, and unauthorized use of others' intellectual property (IP) are strictly prohibited. **All contributions must be original work or clearly attributed and properly licensed.**

### 2.2. Respect for Original Copyright

We fully respect all copyright notices from the original Bincode developers. All code and documentation contributed to **Bincode-next** must maintain proper attribution and adhere to the licensing terms defined for the project.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected of all community members:

* **Be Welcoming and Inclusive:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* **Be Respectful and Considerate:** Respect differing viewpoints and experiences. Engage in technical discussions constructively and avoid personal attacks.
* **Communicate Clearly:** Use clear and professional language. Be mindful of how your words may be interpreted by others, especially across different cultures and languages.
* **Give and Accept Constructive Feedback:** Focus feedback on the code and ideas, not the person.
* **Be Mindful of the Project's Context:** Understand and respect the reasons for the project's fork and the need for a strict anti-harassment policy.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and may result in corrective action, up to and including permanent banning from the project:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Harassment** | Insults, slurs, offensive comments, unwanted attention, or repeated non-constructive criticism. |
| **Doxxing/Threats** | Sharing private identifying information (names, addresses, employers, etc.) without explicit, lawful consent. Making threats of violence or harm. |
| **Legal/IP Violation** | Submitting code or content that infringes on copyright, patents, or trade secrets, or any content that violates applicable law. |
| **Spamming/Trolling** | Posting irrelevant, disruptive, or repeated messages, or engaging in behaviors intended to provoke or disrupt the community. |
| **Retaliation** | Retaliating against anyone for reporting a violation of this CoC. |

## 5. AI-Assisted Development Discussion

The project welcomes discussions on AI system assisted coding and development as part of the Apich mission. **However, these discussions must remain respectful and focused.** Hate speech or harassment directed toward developers using or not using AI assistance is strictly prohibited.

## 6. Reporting and Enforcement

### 6.1. Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct or are concerned about a potential security issue, please report it immediately:

* **For CoC Violations:** Contact the maintainers privately via email at **Pana.Yang@hotmail.com** or through a private message to a project maintainer.
* **For Security Issues:** Contact **Pana.Yang@hotmail.com** or file a private issue report if available on the platform.

All reports will be handled with discretion and treated with seriousness. The identity of the reporter will remain confidential unless required by law.

### 6.2. Enforcement Process

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and enforcing this CoC. Consequences for violations may include:

1. **Warning:** A private or public written warning.
2. **Temporary Ban:** A temporary exclusion from all project communication and contribution channels.
3. **Permanent Ban:** Permanent exclusion from all project spaces.
4. **Legal Referral:** For severe violations (e.g., doxxing, threats), maintainers reserve the right to report the activity to the appropriate legal authorities.

### 6.3. Due Process

Maintainers will investigate reports diligently and fairly. Individuals accused of a violation will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations before a final decision on enforcement is made.
