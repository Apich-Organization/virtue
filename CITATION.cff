abstract: >-
  Bincode-Next is a high-performance binary serialization
  framework for the Rust programming language, established
  as a community-driven restoration of the legacy Bincode
  project. Following the abrupt cessation of original
  maintenance and the subsequent loss of development history
  and transparency (RUSTSEC-2025-0141), Bincode-Next was
  forged to ensure the survival and modernization of this
  critical infrastructure. This implementation introduces
  significant architectural advancements, including nested
  zero-copy support via relative pointers, bit-level packing
  for extreme data density, and schema fingerprinting for
  secure versioning. Bincode-Next stands as a resilient
  successor, reclaiming a vital tool for the Rust ecosystem
  through transparent, team-based governance and modern
  safety standards.
